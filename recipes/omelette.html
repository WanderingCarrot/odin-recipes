    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>In cuisine, an omelett is a dish made from eggs, fried with butter or oil in a frying pan.<br/> It is quite common for the omelette to be folded around fillings such as chives, vegetables, mushrooms, meat, cheese, onions
        <br/> or some combination of the above. Whole eggs or egg whites are often beaten with a small amount of milk, cream, or water.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2-3 eggs</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Beat the eggs</b>: Use two or three eggs per omelette, depending on how hungry you are.
            <br/> Beat the eggs lightly with a fork.
        </li><br/>
        <li>
            <b>Melt the butter</b>: Use an 8-inch nonstick skillet for a 2-egg omelette, a 9-inch skillet for 3 eggs.<br/> Melt the butter over medium-low heat, and keep the temperature low and slow when cooking the eggs so the bottom doesn't
            <br/> get too brown or overcooked.
        </li><br/>
        <li><b>Add the eggs</b>: Let the eggs sit for a minute, then use a heatproof silicone spatula to gently lift the cooked eggs <br/>from the edges of the pan. Tilt the pan to allow the uncooked eggs to flow to the edge of the pan.</li><br/>
        <li><b>Fill the omelette</b>: Add the filling—but don't overstuff the omelette—when the eggs begin to set. Cook for a few more seconds</li><br/>
        <li><b>Fold and serve</b>: Fold the omelette in half. Slide it onto a plate with the help of a silicone spatula.</li><br/>
    </ol>
